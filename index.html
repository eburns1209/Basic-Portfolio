<div class="bio">
	<p>Hello, my name is Erin Stowe. I am originally from Michigan, GO BLUE! I am a former school teacher, who taught in the public school system for 10 years. I thoroughly enjoy working with students and seeing them succeed. I started this class to learn a new skill that will lead to a new career. I enjoy working on computers and helping others. I also enjoy coming up with creative and unique ways to present ideas.</p>

	<p>When I am not working, you can usually find me working out in the gym, running outside, or biking. My husband, Nate and I, like to travel and experience new cultural things. Our goal is to do a race, either a half marathon, marathon, or triathlon in each state.</p>
